Of course. Here is a plan to improve the Power Slicer with multiple choice and selected results features:

   1. Data Model and State Management: I will first update the data model to store an array of selected items. This will allow the slicer to keep track of multiple selections.

   2. UI for Selected Results: I will then add a new UI element to display the selected items. This will likely be a list of "pills" with a remove button for each selected item.

   3. Multiple Choice Dropdown: I will modify the dropdown to allow for multiple selections. This will involve updating the event listeners to add or remove items from the selection array.

   4. Update Filtering: I will update the applyFilter method to handle an array of selected values.

   5. Styling: Finally, I will add styling to the new UI elements to ensure they are visually consistent with the rest of the slicer.p
